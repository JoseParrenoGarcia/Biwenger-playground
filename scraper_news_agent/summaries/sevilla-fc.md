## Transfers
- **Esther Sullastres** has renewed her contract with Sevilla FC Femenino until June 2027, solidifying her role as the team's goalkeeper.
- **Nemanja Gudelj** may leave Sevilla this summer. At 33 years old, he has lost prominence in the team and could be sold to reduce salary costs. The club would consider offers around €5 million.
- **Loïc Badé** is attracting interest from Bayer Leverkusen as a potential replacement for Jonathan Tah, who has moved to Bayern Munich. Sevilla is aware that a substantial offer could prompt them to reconsider his sale.
- **Youssef En-Nesyri** is close to joining Al Hilal for around €40 million, which would yield Sevilla €4 million due to their retained percentage from his previous sale to Fenerbahçe.
- **Federico Gattoni** will remain on loan at River Plate until December 2025, as his loan agreement lasts for a year and a half.
- **Eduard Spertsyan**, a 25-year-old midfielder from Krasnodar, is being considered for a transfer to Sevilla, with a potential price lower than his market value due to his contract situation.
- **Pablo Sarabia** is a potential target for Sevilla if financial conditions allow, as he is a free agent after leaving Wolverhampton Wanderers.
- **Petar Stanic**, a 23-year-old midfielder, has a pre-agreement with Sevilla from the previous management, but the new director, Antonio Cordón, must decide whether to proceed with the deal.
